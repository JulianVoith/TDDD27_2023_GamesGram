# Gamesgram

## Updates

- [2023.04.06] We updated a readme document.

## Overview

### Functional concept
An online platform were people can share screenshots, artworks, ideas or videos about there favorite games/mods of a game. 
The content is either created/shared by normal users or also by game development studios to promote, or gather input for a upcomping game/early access game. 

People can follow specific games or categories but also can discover random media and watch the videos/pictures in a "reel" type of style.

It should be possible to open discussion, polls, comments, leave likes/dislikes, and consume videos/pictures through type of "reel" page by swiping.

The overall goal is also to make it mobile adjusted so an iOS web application can be deployed.
